### Next level remote data workflows for everyone

X-Pipe is a tool for working with remote connections and the data that can be accessed through them.
The focus lies on providing an easy remote connection handling workflow plus data intermediation capabilities
such that you can work with all kinds of data located on essentially any remote system with ease.
So if you are
- a data analyst/scientist
- a system administrator
- a software engineer
- or generally just work a lot with remote connections and data

then X-Pipe is designed for you!

The X-Pipe project is designed to be an open platform, both in terms of development from
a developer's perspective and the workflow from a user's perspective.
X-Pipe is open source and is
designed to utilize and integrate well with other popular tools and workflows,
focusing on augmenting them rather than replacing them.
